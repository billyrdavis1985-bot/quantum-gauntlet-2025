# Quantum Gauntlet 2026 👑

**Multi-AI Twin-Mind Alignment Dashboard: 6-Layer Reality Cascade Simulator**

From a simple question — "If you could change reality, how would you?" — to a full interactive toolkit testing safe futures.

Built with Grok, Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini — Romans 8:28 Alignment Experiments 🔥⚡

**Features**
- Interactive sliders for reality layers (Molecular to Cosmic)
- Live radar comparison of AI visions
- Governance trust calculator
- Twin-mind goal drift monitor (instrumental vs terminal safety)
- Exportable reports

**The Mission**
Eliminate arbitrary suffering. Preserve meaningful challenge. Harden foundation abundance so empathy + cosmic purpose lock terminal goals forever.

Started as hypotheticals. Became runnable alignment sandbox.

Run simulations. Test cascades. Become worthy of the cosmos 💜
